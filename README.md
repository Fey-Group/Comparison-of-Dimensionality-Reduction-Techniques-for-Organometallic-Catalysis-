# Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Organometallic Catalysis

This repo contains code accompanying the manuscript entitled "Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for the Visualisation of Chemical Space in Organometallic Catalysis" in three Jupyter Notebooks:

'DR and Clustering' Loads the LKB-PPscreen ligand data, performs PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE, and runs clustering algorithms
'Information_Retention' Performs multioutput regression on each dataset to determine the information retained with dimensionaity reduction
'Plotting' Produces visualisations as seen in the manuscript
